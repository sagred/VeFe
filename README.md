## Features

### Automatic Transaction Tracking
The app seamlessly integrates with your bank account to automatically track your transactions. Using sophisticated algorithms, it identifies and categorizes eco-friendly purchases. This eliminates the need for manual input and ensures you get rewarded for your green actions effortlessly.

### Rewards System
For every eco-friendly purchase, you earn B3TR tokens. These tokens can be accumulated and redeemed for various rewards. The more you shop sustainably, the more you earn, encouraging a continuous commitment to eco-friendly choices.

### Interactive Map
The app includes an interactive map highlighting eco-friendly stores and zones. Each store listed on the map provides details about their sustainability practices. You can easily locate and support businesses that are committed to sustainability.

### Virtual Pet
Your virtual pet thrives on your sustainable actions. The more eco-friendly purchases you make, the happier and healthier your pet becomes. This gamified element adds a fun and engaging layer to your sustainability journey.

### Challenges and Goals
Engage in various challenges and set personal goals to further your commitment to sustainability. Complete tasks such as making a certain number of eco-friendly purchases in a month to earn badges and additional tokens.

### Badges and Achievements
Collect badges for different achievements such as reaching a milestone number of sustainable transactions or referring friends to the app. Display these badges proudly on your profile.

### Referral Program
Invite friends to join the VeChain Sustainability Tracker. For every 5 tokens your referred friend earns, you get 1 B3TR token. This program not only increases your rewards but also helps spread the movement towards sustainable living.
